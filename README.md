# Dhanush Krishnan's Personal Portfolio Website

## The Code

Basically, the code is more leaning towards CSS and basic HTML with good response to browser height and width, with lots of animation using keyframes and transitions. Javascript codes were used for handling the hamburger menu and the project page scroll effect.

## Thought Process

Based on my coversation with people over time, good visual design in the website is what gets their attention, so my idea here was to try and create a website looking more elegant, hence the reason the code is more CSS effects and less Javascript.

## Problems

It's a challenge coming up with new animations and designs for content which doesn't feel like a duplicate, as all kinds of animation are available online. Also, too much of animation codes can be confusing.

## To be Completed...

Few projects based on API's are work in progress. I am hoping to add them in my Projects section soon.
