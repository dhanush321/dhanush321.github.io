# Dhanush Krishnan's Personal Portfolio Website

## The Code

Basically, the code is more leaning towards CSS and basic HTML with good response to browser height and width. Lots of animations using keyframes and transitions. Few Javascript codes for handling the hamburger menu and the project page scroll effect.

## Thought Process

Based on my coversation with people over time, good visual design in the website is what which gets their attention, so my idea here was to try and create a website looking more elegant, hence the reason the code is more CSS effects and minimum Javascript.

## Problems

It's a challenge, coming up with new animations and designs for contents which doesn't feel like a duplicate as almost all kinds are available online.Also, too much of animation codes can be confusing.

## To be Completed...

Few projects based on API's are work in progress. I am hoping to add them in my Projects section soon.
